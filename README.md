# Movie-Catalog

•	For this project I implemented a doubly linked list that stores books on a bookshelf, sorted by their respective ID.  
•	The application creates Book objects using the given or defaulted information about title, authors, and page count, as well as creating an ID system for keeping track of the books.  
•	The main objects used for this application were the linked nodes, the book objects that were placed into the nodes, and the LinkedBookshelf, which stored the nodes according to their assigned ID number.
